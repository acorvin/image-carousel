# image-carousel

This project is based on the Background Image Slider Project in the
[Javascript Tutorial and Projects Course](https://www.udemy.com/javascript-tutorial-for-beginners/) by John Smilga.

In the course, John uses Bootstrap for the DOM projects. However, I have removed Bootstrap entirely from my project. While I love Bootstrap, I did not wish to lean on it for this particular project as I would not be utilizing it much.

Aside from some CSS styling, I have also implemented an automatic slideshow function which currently begins playback 8 seconds after the window has loaded.

This project is still in process and I will be including toggling between automatic and manual controls, which is currently not set, as well as some new features which will be revealed as the project progresses.
